<div dir="ltr">Hi,<div><br></div><div><div><p>You may have noticed that support for older TLS versions is being removed from websites all over the internet. With the ever evolving security landscape and the perpetual game of cat and mouse between attackers and cryptography we need to ensure that we keep abreast of industry best practice.</p><p><br></p> <p>Cryptography attacks are nothing new. While there are workarounds for many of them available, what they tell us is that some protocols are best left behind when there is a better way forward.</p><p><br></p> <p>TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have been around a very long time now. But it is time to move on and remove support for these older, less secure, protocols. As a result the Chocolatey website will remove support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 on 3 February 2020.</p></div><div><br></div><div>Find out more in our blog post https://chocolatey.org/blog/remove-support-for-old-tls-versions.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards,</div><div><br></div><div>Paul</div></div> <p></p> -- <br/> You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups &quot;chocolatey-announce&quot; group.<br/> To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to <a href="mailto:chocolatey-announce+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com">chocolatey-announce+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com</a>.<br/> To view this discussion on the web visit <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/chocolatey-announce/5687ba44-a4e0-4401-9230-cb73dfacf223%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer">https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/chocolatey-announce/5687ba44-a4e0-4401-9230-cb73dfacf223%40googlegroups.com</a>.<br/>
