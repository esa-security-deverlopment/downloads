ICANN has published the portions of the documents submitted to it regarding
the proposed sale of .ORG that ISOC/PIR/Ethos agreed to make public, see:

 
https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/pir-isoc-ethos-capital-10jan20-e
n.pdf  

Here is the process for the change in ownership (page 22 of the PDF file):

"The Internet Society ("ISOC") has created a newly formed supporting
organization, Connected Giving Foundation, a non-profit Pennsylvania entity
("CGF"), for which
it serves as its sole member. CGF is expected to be a Section 501(c)(3)
public
charity. Prior to, but in tandem with the closing of the Transaction, CGF
will
become a member of PIR and upon the conversion of PIR to PIR LLC, ISOC will
no longer be a member of PIR LLC, and CGF will be the sole member of PIR
LLC. Immediately thereafter, CGF will then sell its 100% membership in PIR
to Purpose
Domains Direct, LLC." 

I have the following questions regarding this process. 

Will CGF be the entity that controls the endowment fund that will be created
using the $ 1.135 billion received from the sale of .ORG?

If not, what happens to CGF after the transaction is completed? 

And why was it necessary to crate CGF? Couldn't the transaction have taken
place without the creation of CGF?

Best,
Richard
